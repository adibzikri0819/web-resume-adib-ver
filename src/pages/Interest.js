            Through my academic journey, I have found a few things that I am passionate for, which are
            including web development and software engineering. I am currently interested in building free
            websites by using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Angular. Not only that, I am also interested in other
            areas as well, such as writing and regular sports like jogging. Thank you for taking the time to review
            my resume. I look forward to talking with you.
